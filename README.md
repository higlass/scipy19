**Presentation** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v62k4Ok1S8g)

**Slides**: [slides.pdf](slides.pdf) or [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/flekschas/to-a-billion-and-beyond-how-to-visually-explore-compare-and-share-large-quantitative-datasets-with-higlass)

**Demos**:
- [basic-setup.ipynb](basic-setup.ipynb): Simplest example possible to check that HiGlass loads properly in Jupyter Lab.
- [temperature.ipynb](temperature.ipynb): Introduction to the python API for HiGlass using temperature measurements over the last \~50 years.
- [point-data.ipynb](point-data.ipynb): An example of how the tileset API works and how one can build their own API from scratch.
- [nyc-taxi.ipynb](nyc-taxi.ipynb): Demonstrate advanced features using the NYC Taxi dataset.
- [genomics.ipynb](genomics.ipynb): Show how to work with and extend published HiGlass dashboards for collaboration and reproducibility.


## Getting started

#### Requirements

- Conda `v4.6.14` (or higher)
- FUSE: [libfuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) `v2.9.7` (or higher) or [OSXFUSE](https://osxfuse.github.io/) `v3.9.2` (or higher)

_Other versions might work too but we only tested the above mentioned versions._

#### Installation

First, install the environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/higlass/scipy19
cd scipy19
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Next, install HiGlass' jupyter extension:

```
conda activate higlass-scipy19
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@1.0
jupyter labextension install higlass-jupyter@0.2.1
```

Finally, start Jupyterlab:

```
jupyter-lab
```



## Trouble shooting

- If Conda fails to set up the environment please make sure you're using the latest version of Conda and update if necessary using:

   ```
   conda update -n base conda
   ```
   
   - If you end up with a half-created environment:
   
   ```
   CondaValueError: prefix already exists: /Users/me/miniconda3/envs/higlass-scipy19
   ```
   
   - You may have to delete it before continuing:
   
   ```
   $ rm -rf /Users/me/miniconda3/envs/higlass-scipy19
   ```

- If Conda seems to have gotten stuck, first check your processes using `top` or alike. Conda is dead slow these days and might just need some extra time. In the meantime you can make yourself a nice cup of coffee, go out for lunch, or head to Hawaii for your summer vacation.

- If starting HiGlass fails and you see an issue related to FUSE telling you a `RuntimeError` popped up with the following _super helpful and elaborate_ error message: `1`, then you most likely need to update FUSE. If HiGlass does start then you can ingore the error. The error goes away if you keep unmounting previously mounted values using `umount HttpFs`.
